    Gia still can't believe it.
    
    They somehow traveled back to Dr. Jose Rizal’s time.
    
    As far as she could remember, there was a sudden earthquake.
    
    The next thing they know, Jose Rizal himself, was staring at them, questioning them in Spanish.
    
    Thankfully, Rizal bought their story and took them in as his students.
    
    Every day, Gia takes classes with the other students.
    
    They called Rizal their maestro and he proved to be an interesting, if not strict, teacher.
    
    Rizal taught them reading, writing, geography, mathematics, nature study, morality, and gymnastics.
    
    They would often go outside of their classes because Rizal believes that practical knowledge and developing their skills would help them survive in the world.
    
    Although they had pretty much adapted, Gia still couldn’t figure out how they got here and what was the purpose of it all.
    
    She usually sits under the shade of the Balduno tree with her pen and paper, pondering and writing her thoughts away.
